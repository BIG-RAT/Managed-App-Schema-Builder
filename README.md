Download: [Managed App Schema Builder](https://github.com/BIG-RAT/Managed-App-Schema-Builder/releases/download/current/Managed.App.Schema.Builder.zip)

Before wasting time creating something that's already been done see if it's available:

* [https://github.com/ProfileCreator/ProfileManifests](https://github.com/ProfileCreator/ProfileManifests)

* [https://github.com/Jamf-Custom-Profile-Schemas/ProfileManifestsMirror](https://github.com/Jamf-Custom-Profile-Schemas/ProfileManifestsMirror)





Otherwise use the app to create a JSON file that can be used to set application preferences.  Then don't be shy, if it's new please share what you have crafted.

Starting with Jamf Pro v10.19 you are able to create a custom schema, in the form of a JSON, to create a template for setting application preferences within the Application & Custom Settings payload (Computer Configuration Profiles).


Consult the [Wiki](https://github.com/BIG-RAT/Managed-App-Schema-Builder/wiki) (which needs updating) for usage information.
